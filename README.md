# Something about Snake
or a Dreamy Slitherer

## Blerb 01
In this snake-inspired game, the player (who looks suspiciously similar to the developer’s girlfriend) explores a land of doodles and imagination.

## Blerb 02
What is inside the mind? Trails that lead nowhere in particular. Surprises around every corner. Inspired by minimalist 8bit graphics.

## Blerb 03
A great game for high, or just generally space-brained folks who need a break from our stupid, product-driven capitalist trap of a society. Be free! Be... something like snake.
